There are no results when I run ``man libkmip``. Why not?
---------------------------------------------------------
The current build and install process does not generate ``man`` compatible
documentation output.

The libkmip documentation is written in `RST`_ and is built as HTML by
``sphinx``. It is typically installed under ``/usr/local/share/doc/kmip``.
It is available online on `ReadTheDocs`_.

For more information, see :ref:`writing-docs` and
:ref:`building-libkmip-on-linux`.
